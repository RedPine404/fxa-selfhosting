From v1.235.1 to v1.242.4
1. code/token or oauth code prune are not done with db connect.
	so we need a db event for oauth code (because it's simple) like DELETE FROM codes WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, createdAt, NOW()) > 86400  // a day in sec
		a cron job to run prune-tokens (because there're redis part)
			for prune-token ,we only do token and code (as previous) , not touch session
				because we should not judge how many sessions a user have.
			is abusing docker HEALTHCHEK for scheduled job a good idea

2.  mysql 5.7 -> 8.0


For MySQL 8.0.15 and earlier: You need to complete the upgrade process by running the mysql_upgrade utility in the MySQL 8.0 Server container (the step is not required for MySQL 8.0.16 and later):

3. pusbox change from httpdb to direct db
	add pushbox db configs in db-migration and fxa-auth-server
	to avoid mix-up PUSHBOX_DIRECT_DB_PERCENT=100

	pushbox.local is not necessary now.
	
	1) drop database if exists pushbox ->  let  db-migration create database pushbox_new and fxa-auth use pushbox_new
		old data?
	2) modify db-migration add if not exists for index , but old db has disel_migration table , should clean up.
	

	fxa_event of deleted user ???? cleanup  -> impl in 1.245.0 , becasue we are in same framework, no need event ,just do db delete.

-1. https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/pull/13741  consider removing this limit (cuz we are not mozilla, we can have @firefox.com as mail address)


From v1.242.4 to v1.245.0
1. ACCOUNT_EVENTS_ENABLED in auth-server  maybe False
