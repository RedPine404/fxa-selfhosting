FULLY SELF SIGN which is useful in local lan and you want https

NOTE:
debug.full_self_sign_workaround must be true to enable a workaround for full self sign with fxa-graphql-api to achieve that inter-service in docker communicating with each other using HTTP.

IN HOST MACHINE (assume 192.168.100.101)
1. modify (like common name ,subjectAltName , days) and run ./examples/full_selfsign/generate-cert.sh 
2. edit config.yml's domain.name
3. if using reverse proxy:
	use cert generated by `generate-cert.sh`in reverse proxy  see ./examples/reverse_proxy_nossl/reverse_proxy.conf  ./examples/reverse_proxy_ssl/reverse_proxy.conf

	config.yml's nginx conf see ./examples/reverse_proxy_nossl/config.yml  ./examples/reverse_proxy_ssl/config.yml

4. else:

	modify config.yml make nginx listen at 443 and use cert generated by `generate-cert.sh` see ./examples/full_selfsign/config.yml

IN USER MACHINE
NOTE: all steps are important!!! espically step 1 and 3
1. update /etc/hosts to point all subdomains to HOST MACHINE ( 192.168.100.101 )
2. update firefox config accroding to init.sh output
3. import RootCA.crt into firefox via about:preferences#privacy => View certificates => import => check `Trust this CA to identity websites`
4. sign in
